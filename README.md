# ELIC
This repository is an unofficial PyTorch implementation variants of ELIC: efficient Learned Image Compression withUnevenly Grouped Space-Channel Contextual Adaptive Coding [(CVPR 2022)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/He_ELIC_Efficient_Learned_Image_Compression_With_Unevenly_Grouped_Space-Channel_Contextual_CVPR_2022_paper.html).

>  This repository is based on [CompressAI](https://github.com/InterDigitalInc/CompressAI) and [TinyLIC](https://github.com/lumingzzz/TinyLIC).

## About

I replaced the checkerboard context model in the original ELIC with Multistage Context Model (MCM) in TinyLIC for further enhancing spatial context information. When implementing other modules, my reimplementation version is as consistent as possible with the description in the ELIC.

## Current Progress

Preparing pre-trained models for different bitrate...

>  I will release the codes while the results meets expectations.
